# Data sources - `_src_[sourcename].yml`

Inside **each** source subfolder (*jaffle_shop* and *google_analytics*), create `_src_[sourcename].yml` yaml file. Edit `_src_[sourcename].yml` and add table reference to the raw data. Sources make it possible to name and describe the data loaded into your warehouse.
    
```yaml
version: 2

sources:
 - name: test
   database: raw ## db name
   schema: raw_test # schema where it sits
   description: [Describe source table]
   tables:
     - name: table_test # name by which we reference it, can be the same as in db or different
       identifier: profiles # optional if name in the db is not same as above
       
 ```

:::{admonition} Data loading options
 Data can be loaded into DB by either using some EL tool like Meltano, Fivetran etc. or by uploading `.csv` files. By running dbt command `dbt seed` you can easily load your .csv files into your database. Place all .csv files in seeds folder within you dbt folder. Destination schema can be modified in `dbt_project.yml` by adding:
```yaml
seeds:
  +schema: seeds
```

üìù **example for `_src_jaffle_shop.yml`**

 ```yaml
 version: 2
 
 sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    schema: raw
    tables:
      - name: orders
        columns:
          - name: id
            tests:
              - unique
      - name: customers
        columns: id
          - name: 
            tests:
              - unique
      - name: payments
        columns:
          - name: id
            tests:
              - unique
```

## Exercise

Run `dbt test --select source:jaffle_shop`
