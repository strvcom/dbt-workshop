# Creating staging models

The staging layer is where our journey begins. This is the foundation of our project, where we bring all the individual components we're going to use to build our more complex and useful models into the project. We are going to learn how to create staging models `stg_[sourcename]_[tablename].sql` with the help of base models `base_[sourcename]_[tablename].sql`.

```{admonition} Goal of this section:
Create staging models for each data source that are clean and can support simple analysis.
