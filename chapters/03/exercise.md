# Exercise

1. **Create base models:** create base models for each source table (total 4 base models). Make sure all `id` columns are renamed according to the entity they represent e.g. for customer table set `id as customer_id`. *(tip: sample SQL for `base_jaffle_shop_customers` is already included as [the example](../03/base_models.md) in the lecture)*
2. **Create staging models:** 
    * firstly create staging models for each base table (total 4 staging models). In `stg_jaffle_shop_payments` filter only payments where amount is bigger than 0. *(tip: sample SQL for `stg_jaffle_shop_customers` is already included as [the example](../03/staging_models.md) in the lecture)*
    * then create one additional `stg_jaffle_shop_orders_value` model which will be selecting from already created `stg_jaffle_shop_payments` model in the previous step. This model should contain columns: `order_id`, `total_amount` and `coupon_amount` (tip: use case when payment_method ...)

3. **Fill `_stg_[sourcename].yml` files:** finish [the provided example](../03/documentation_tests.html#summary)   for `_stg_jaffle_shop.yml` file and fill `_stg_google_analytics.yml`. 

Once it is all set, don't forget to run your models by `dbt run` command and test your models by `dbt test` in your terminal

## Solution

**1. Base models**

:::{admonition} `base_jaffle_shop_customers.sql`
:class: dropdown

```
with source as (

  select * from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'customers') }}

), renamed as (

  select
    id as customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name
  from source

)

select * from renamed
```
:::


:::{admonition} `base_jaffle_shop_orders.sql`
:class: dropdown

```
with source as (

  select * from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'orders') }}

), renamed as (

  select
    id as order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    status
  from source

)

select * from renamed
```

    order_id,
    sum(amount) as total_amount,
    sum(case payment_method when 'coupon' then amount else 0 end) as coupon_amount
  from payments
  group by 1

)

select * from aggregated
```
